Garbage collectors in space. In the future space travel is a normal every-day occurence (like flying on a plane is today), but this has created a serious problem with orbital debris. Story follows the debris collecting section of a corporate space station.

### Episodes
 - [S1E1 - Outside The Atmosphere](S1E1%20-%20Outside%20The%20Atmosphere.md)
 - [S1E2 - Like A Dream](S1E2%20-%20Like%20A%20Dream.md)
 - 

### Notable
 - Story has a major change (introduction of debris collection laws) introduced by a very public disaster. Good way to introduce a large change into a story.
