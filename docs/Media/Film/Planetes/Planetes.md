Garbage collectors in space. In the future space travel is a normal every-day occurence (like flying on a plane is today), but this has created a serious problem with orbital debris. Story follows the debris collecting section of a corporate space station.

### Episodes
 - [S1E1](S1E1)
 - [S1E2](S1E2)
 - 

### Notable
 - Story has a major change (introduction of debris collection laws) introduced by a very public disaster. Good way to introduce a large change into a story.
