- Claire (middle management) is discussing with Dolph (manging director of second division) about how debris collection is unprofitable. Pay is awarded by a government body (INTO) based on a "points value" and doesn't usually cover expenses.
- Hackimaki is training Tanabe on how to use the target tracking features of the EVA suit helmet.
- Colin Clifford interrupts (rudely), he's the son of the director of INTO. Claire enters and explain that they will be accompanying the debris team today.
- Claire, Hachimaki and Fee discuss why debris section has been given this assignment - it's a political favour to get more valuable debris assigned to the section.
- Technically guests are not allowed on the ship, but given who is father is Colin is allowed onboard the ship without any record of his presence.
- After the debris is collected and they're about to return to ISPV-7 Claire suddenly requests a change of course to see a certain satellite.
- It turns out that on a recent recreational spacewalk Colin left a camera in space (a serious crime). They've been diverted here to pick it up quietly. Hachimaki is enraged and refuses to collect the item. Fee says she'll collect it - after all it's still debris and it's still dangerous.
- Colin deliberately tries to provoke Hachimaki into punching him, to get him fired. But Tanabe cuts in and punches Colin first.
- Colin insists that he'll get Tanabe fired, but Fee and Yuri insist that since no non-employees were ever onboard the ship according to the records then of course no violence against Colin could have happened!
