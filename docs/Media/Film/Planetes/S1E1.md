- Opening shows a passenger SSTO, destroyed by a single screw smashing into it.
- This event explains the change in public opinion and political will that lead to the creation of debris collectors.
- Ai Tanabe (main character, newbie astronaut assigned to debris section) meets her colleagues
	- Fee Carmichael - Captain of the debris collector ship DS-12 "toybox"
	- Yuri Mihairokov - First mate of toybox
	- Hachirota "Hachimaki" Hoshino - astronaut who collects debris from toybox
	- Philippe Myers - debris section chief clerk
	- Arvind "Robbie" Lavie - debris section assistant clerk
	- Edelgard Rivera - debris section secretary handling paperwork
- Toybox is dispatched to collect a piece of debris, a commemorative plate celebrating peave in "Mananga", and to drop it into the atmosphere to burn up
- Navigation displays shows the ships intercepting the plate and performing a retro burn to drop it
- Toybox deploys a smaller ship (just a seat, open frame and an engine) to rendezvous with the debris
- An argument ensues about destroying the plate (a symbol of peace) just to save the satellite it's on a collision course with (a military spy satellite)
- Hackimaki attaches a small thruster to the plate
- Debris section deliberately delay the de-orbit burn to send it down in a beautiful light show over "Mananga"
- Or maybe it was just to earn overtime ;)
