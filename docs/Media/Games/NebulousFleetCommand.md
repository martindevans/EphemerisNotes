[Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/887570/NEBULOUS_Fleet_Command/)

Take command of a fleet of space warships tailored to your exact play-style. Favor a small task group of robust, flexible multi-role combatants, a large group of specialized ships, or something in between. Do battle in a heavily simulation-based tactical game featuring everything from kinetics and beam weapons to realistic radar and electronic warfare.

- **Realistic Systems Simulation**
	- Radar, E-WAR, Missile capabilities etc are all fairly accurate.
	- Ship internals, layouts, crew capabilities are realistic-ish (2D, makes sense for a battleship but probably not a spaceship)
- **Unrealistic Physics**
	- Totally unrealistic movement, it's naval warfare in space.
