 - Fleet config screen
 - Turn based sector map
 - Earn "renown" by completing missions
 - Objectives often unclear
 - Enemy abilities that cannot be countered (e.g. warp ships out)
 - Not much to do in some battles (set abilites to autocast and watch ships orbit each other)
 - Battle damage clear (HP bar goes down)
	 - However not very _interesting_, you're just shooting a red bar
	 - No visible signs of damage
