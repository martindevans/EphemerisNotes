Children Of A Dead Earth (COADE) is an accurate simulation of space warfare, much the same as Ephemeris is aiming to be.

- **REAL SCIENCE, REAL TECHNOLOGY**
	- All tech derived from real experimental/theoretical results.
- **EXTREMELY ACCURATE ORBITAL MECHANICS**
	- N-Body orbital simulator.
	- All orbital phenomenon from hyperbolic orbits, Lagrange points, and orbital perturbation are all correctly simulated.
	- Spacecraft can stationkeep orbits, or enter into free falling perturbed orbits.  
- **1:1 SCALE**
	- The solar system is modeled completely to scale.
- **FREEFORM SHIP DESIGN**
	- Build your spacecrafts out of rockets, propellant tanks, weapons, powerplants, radiators, and crew modules.
	- Multiple armor layers and whipple Shielding.
	- Acceleration, moment of inertia, delta-v, and much more are all correctly calculated for all spacecrafts you design.  
- **HIGHLY GRANULAR MODULE DESIGN**
	- Design the systems used in freeform ship design.
	- Tweak everything from the nozzle length or stoichiometric mixture ratio of your bipropellant rockets to the armature and rail dimensions of your railguns.
- **PHYSICALLY ACCURATE MATERIAL PROPERTIES**
	- All materials, chemical reactions, and spectra are physically correct.
- **STEAM WORKSHOP SUPPORT**
	- Import/Export ships, systems and scenarios.
