## Monday 1st
- Created "base" scene which contains the various necessary things to make up a scene
	- Skybox config (galaxy)
	- Instanced stars renderer
	- Camera stack (big/little)
	- Postprocessing volume
- Experimented with cinemachine and layered cameras
	- Seems to work as expected
- Adjusted Earth graphics (improving atmospheric scattering)
- Introduced "layer" tag types, which allows distinguishing layers in the type system. These types have a property specifying the scaling for that layer (meters per unit)
	- Changed some Myriad components/systems to require layer tags. This allows multiple to be bound for different layers.
		- `ScenePosition<TLayer>`, `UnityTransform<TLayer>`, `SetScenePositionFromWorldPosition<TLayer>`
- Tested compositing camera layers in SolarSystem scene, setting NBody as focus.
- Investigated feasibility of using Unity job system for scheduling integrator work
## Tuesday 2nd
 - Investigated poor performance with integrator and a large number of NBodies (1000+)
	 - Fixed a bug that was causing excess tasks to be allocated - one task per nbody per frame, even if no work was needed!
	 - Wrote a new version of the integrator based on Unity jobs instead of dotnet tasks
 - Expanded Myriad.ECS query API (adding various overloads which allow not passing some params, or passing them by ref).
 - Added new event type, so the visual origin and the rail relative origin are different things.
 - Started building `CameraStackController` behaviour, to manage everything involved in switching camera modes
## Wednesday 3rd
- Experimented with bloom/lens dirt. URP lens flare asset can't use HDR colour, so interacting with bloom is difficult.
- Worked on `CameraStackController`
	- Mode transition (small vs astronomical)
	- Integration with cinemachine
		- copying appropriate data from cinemachine
		- activating/deactivating vcams on transition
		- changing channel on brain to work with relevant vcams
		- hard cut on transition
	- Developing an orbital camera
	- `NBodyOrbitLine` rendering is broken in small mode, need to think about how to offset that into the right position
- Investigating Unity new Input System (easier to use with Cinemachine, maybe)
