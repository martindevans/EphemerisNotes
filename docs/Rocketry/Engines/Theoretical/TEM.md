**Transport and Energy Module** (TEM, Space Tug Zeus) is a nuclear electric space tug intended to solve a wide range of tasks such as cargo delivery to the moon, geostationary orbit and Mars as well as orbital debris collection.

The spacecraft uses a megawatt-class nuclear reactor to provide electric power to a very large electric propulsion system (ion engines, `ID-500`). Cooling is provided by a drip cooler-emitter.
