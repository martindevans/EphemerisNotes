However, this simulation must be displayed in the Unity scene. This is a problem - the Unity scene uses single precision coordinates for position, there is a fundamental part of the engine and there is no way to change this. As mentioned in Precision & Scale Unity recommends a maximum scene size of 50km (i.e. 50,000 units) at most. To fix this Ephemeris uses three tricks: scale, floating origin and offsetting.","permalink":"/EphemerisNotes/ImplementationDetails/Rendering/SceneScaleTricks"}]}')}}]);
